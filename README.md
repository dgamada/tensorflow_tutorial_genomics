This repository contains some notebooks that cover introductory material for TensorFlow.

# Tutorials TensorFlow

	* Notebook Tensorflow Basics: overview of key TensorFlow concepts, including graphs, variables, ops, placeholders, sessions

	* Notebook Tensorflow MLP epistasis: explore a MLP for an experimental epistasis dataset

	* Notebook CNN TF: explore a CNN to predict transcription factor binding from experimental ChIP-seq data

	* Notebook CNN RNAcompete:  explore a CNN to predict the experimental specificities of RNA-binding proteins to RNA probes using sequence and secondary structure predictions

	* Example VAE MNIST: example of a variational autoencoder trained on the MNIST dataset


# Tutorials Deepomics


	* Notebook Deepomics CNN TF: example of how to use deepomics to train, test, and evaluate a CNN for a supervised classification task
